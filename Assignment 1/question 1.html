        About Myself</h1>
        <p>

I’m Suvam Das, a 19-year-old from Cuttack, Odisha, currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Information Technology (CSIT) at ITER, SOA. I’m in my 3rd semester and really enjoying the journey so far. I completed both my 10th and 12th grades at DAV Public School, where I worked hard and did well academically. In my free time, I love watching movies and series, which helps me relax and sparks my imagination. I also like to draw occasionally, using it as a creative outlet. I’m passionate about technology and am excited to see where my studies in CSIT will take me in the future.
