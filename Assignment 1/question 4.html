Cuttack, one of the oldest cities in Odisha, is known for its rich history and vibrant culture. Often referred
 to as the "Millennium City," Cuttack blends tradition with modernity. One of the city's iconic landmarks is the
 Barabati Fort, which stands as a reminder of Cuttack's glorious past. Built in the 14th century, the fort
reflects the architectural brilliance of that era and is a favorite spot for history enthusiasts.
